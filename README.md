# 🧩 SharePoint Code Editor WebPart
Welcome to the SharePoint Code Editor WebPart – a powerful, flexible, and community-first solution that empowers you to write and embed custom code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) directly into SharePoint pages. Designed with safety, usability, and collaboration in mind, this web part is completely free and open to the SharePoint community.

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Sandbox Mode
Run your code safely in an isolated <iframe> environment. This prevents broken or untrusted code from affecting the rest of your SharePoint page.

### 👁️ Visibility Control
Target specific devices where you want your webpart to appear, wether its for Desktop, Tablet or Mobile Devices.

### 🛠️ Built-in Testing Tools
If something goes wrong, no need to panic. Simply add ?spdisablecode=1 to your URL to instantly disable the web part and regain control.

### 🔖 Smart Tags (Dynamic Variables)
Our favorite feature! Define variables inside your code using special tags, and they’ll appear as editable fields in the UI. This allows non-technical users to easily update code behavior without touching the code, making it portable, reusable, and shareable.

### ⬇️ Import & Export
Easily export your code (HTML, CSS, JS) from one instance and import it into another with a single click. Perfect for replicating setups across multiple pages or sites.
